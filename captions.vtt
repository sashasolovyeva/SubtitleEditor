Juliane Camfield: Good afternoon. My name is Juliane Camfield,
I'm the director of Deutsches Haus at NYU&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.920
and it is my great pleasure to&nbsp;
welcome you to today's event.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.640
We are absolutely delighted to award our eighth&nbsp;
annual Volkmar and Margret Sander prize to Dr. Heinz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.080
Ickstadt this afternoon on November 9th, which is,
of course, a very momentous day in german history.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.360
Heinz Ickstadt is professor Emeritus of American&nbsp;
literature at the Kennedy institute of North&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.400
American studies at the free university&nbsp;
Berlin, where he taught from 1978 through 2003.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.040
His publications include a history of the American&nbsp;
novel in the 20th century and essays on late&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.840
19th century American literature and culture,
the fiction and poetry of American modernism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.920
and post-modernism, and the history&nbsp;
and theory of American studies. Some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.680
of these were collected in "Faces of Fiction:&nbsp;
ssays on American Literature and Culture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.240
from the Jacksonian Age to Postmodernity" and&nbsp;
"Aesthetic Innovation and the Democratic Principle"

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.080
essays on 20th century American poetry and&nbsp;
fiction. He also edited and co-edited several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.600
books on American literature and culture, among&nbsp;
them a bilingual anthology of American poetry and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.880
a bilingual edition of Ezra Pound's "Cantos". He was&nbsp;
president of the german association of American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:54.720
studies from 1990 until 1993, and president of the&nbsp;
European association of American studies from 1996&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.840
until 2000. As many of you will remember,&nbsp;
the Volkmar and Margret Sander prize was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.040
established by professor Margret Sander in memory&nbsp;
of her late husband, professor Volkmar Sander, former&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:15.840
head of the german department of NYU and founder&nbsp;
and first director of Deutsches Haus at NYU.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.480
The prestigious annual prize, which was awarded&nbsp;
for the first time in 2013 to the late Fritz Stern,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:34.640
to Gary Smith in 2014, to Lya Friedrich Pfeifer
in 2015, to Claus Leggewie in 2016, to Karsten Voigt

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:46.000
in 2017, to Henry Jarecki in 2018, and to Susan&nbsp;
Nieman in 2019 (and last year we had to take a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.120
hiatus because of COVID), is endowed with a five&nbsp;
thousand dollar grant and honors individuals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.520
who have made outstanding contributions to the&nbsp;
cultural, political, and academic relationship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.520
between the german-speaking world and the united&nbsp;
states. Heinz Ickstadt, by the way, kindly decided to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:14.480
donate the monetary award to a good cause or&nbsp;
two – thanks so much for this generous gesture.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.080
Deutsches Haus at NYU continues to be very&nbsp;
grateful to Margret Sander for establishing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.600
annual award, thereby providing Deutsches Haus at&nbsp;
NYU with the much-appreciated opportunity to honor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:36.880
such worthy and distinguished individuals as Heinz&nbsp;
Ickstadt, whose amazing work has been instrumental for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.840
the enhancement of not only the Transatlantic&nbsp;
dialogue, and whose teaching and research has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.240
been tremendously inspiring for so many people on&nbsp;
both sides of the Atlantic for quite a few decades.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.400
I'm able to attest to that from my own experience&nbsp;
as a student of his at Freie Universität Berlin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.680
many moons ago. And, this is perhaps TMI [too much information], without&nbsp;
Heinz Ickstadt seminar about Thomas Pinchen,&nbsp;

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:13.120
I wouldn't be giving this speech. I would like&nbsp;
to thank the friends of Volkmar and Margret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.760
Sander with a big shout-out to Joan Reutershan and Marty Black, who have been strong champions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.720
of the Sander prize and of Deutsches Haus at&nbsp;
NYU in general for a long time. I'm therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.800
delighted to now introduce Marty Black from&nbsp;
the Friends of Volkmar and Margret Sander to you,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.200
who has kindly agreed to provide some remarks
on behalf of the Friends. marty, here you go.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.160

painting behind Margret that's a landscape&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:19.200
painted by a painter named george weiler uh not&nbsp;
too far from nepal's in in upstate New York and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.640
it is of course very telling that Margret&nbsp;
has this painting in her house in odenweit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.160
a painting that still connects&nbsp;
her to her time in New York

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.360

for their dedicated work to realize our manifold&nbsp;
programs and endeavors including the special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.120
awards ceremony and of course everything has&nbsp;
been so much more difficult since covet hit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:02.000
so I really appreciate all the extra energy&nbsp;
that we have to invest in making things possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

together she and I started crafting the idea of&nbsp;&nbsp;

Heinz Ickstadt as the future thunder prize awardee&nbsp;
during zuzana's stay in New York thank you Susanna&nbsp;&nbsp;

history the deutsches house at NYU is honoring&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:42.240
Heinz with the Volkmar and Margret Sander prize&nbsp;
it's an honor for me to be a part of the ceremony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.400
and a chance for me to pay tribute to a scholar&nbsp;
who has shaped my thinking about American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.560
literature and my life for many years Heinz was&nbsp;
chair of the literature department at the john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.600
f Kennedy institute for north American studies at&nbsp;
the free university of Berlin when I came there as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:03.520
a young fulbright lecturer in 2002 he made me feel&nbsp;
at home so much at home that I'm still in Germany&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:10.080
where I teach American literature today when i&nbsp;
think back over those 20 years or so I picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:16.000
Heinz in a couple of characteristic settings&nbsp;
he's in a classroom or at a conference or at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.160
the Kennedy institute's weekly colloquium talking&nbsp;
but also actively listening to what others say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.320
i also see him at the parties that he and his wife&nbsp;
leonora would regularly throw at their apartment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.480
on bundessale where similar conversations&nbsp;
but spilling over from books to music and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.200
dance in recent plays would include larger groups&nbsp;
made up of dancers friends visiting authors and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.120
local cultural figures these parties still take&nbsp;
place and always last until late into the night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.960
there were legendary parties before&nbsp;
my time at a house on bingastrassa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:57.760
which had been damaged in the war and had a&nbsp;
crack running down one wall to the foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:04.320
that house no longer stands its fall even&nbsp;
suggests a parable by edgar allan poe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.080
however the ick shots built something on top of&nbsp;
that foundation that helped repair the damage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:17.520
a house divided they also helped build a bridge&nbsp;
aGross the atlantic to the united states poe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.560
was decidedly not the inspiration behind Heinz&nbsp;
Heinz's discovery of American literature rather&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:30.000
it was a class on herman melville taught by an&nbsp;
American guest professor that hein stumbled upon&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.680
as an undergraduate Heinz was actually majoring in&nbsp;
german literature at the time but he was unhappy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.240
in the german department partly because the&nbsp;
classes were over full and partly because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.800
were taught by professors whose authoritarian&nbsp;
demeanor reflected their wartime experiences&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.720
and perhaps some of the attitudes that led to&nbsp;
the holocaust the problem was not just in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:59.760
classroom Heinz is of that generation of students&nbsp;
whose fathers returned from the war broken&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:07.920
and bankrupt in more than one sense Heinz's&nbsp;
father was a baker we can thank a flower allergy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.280
for Heinz's refusal to follow him into the&nbsp;
family business of course he did not want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.280
follow his father's footsteps for other reasons&nbsp;
as well the class on melville gave him a glimpse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:25.280
of some alternatives the life of the mind as&nbsp;
opposed to physical labor democracy and pluralism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:32.720
as opposed to a political and cultural tradition&nbsp;
tainted by Germany's recent past Heinz's essays&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.480
make it clear that he early on identified with&nbsp;
ishmael in his quest for meaning and companionship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.520
the authoritarian ahab on the other hand seemed to&nbsp;
anticipate many of the 20th century's catastrophes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:53.440
from melville's sinking ship which seemed so&nbsp;
pertinent to Heinz's situation perhaps because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:00.880
of its American-ness Heinz turned to a concrete&nbsp;
metaphor that seemed improbably to stay afloat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:06.880
this was hart crane's brooklyn bridge his&nbsp;
dissertation on crain explores how a single&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:12.000
lyrical voice can be divided in the same way&nbsp;
melville's characters were divided between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.640
opposing viewpoints it is the job of poetic&nbsp;
language to bridge that divide with concrete&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:25.600
images of unification crane's poetic quest to&nbsp;
bring together contradictory American views&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.440
would become one of Heinz's recurrent themes&nbsp;
it would also become his personal quest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:39.040
Heinz is a bridge builder he loves to talk about&nbsp;
literature but he does so to make connections&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:45.360
between people between ideas perspectives and&nbsp;
places when he wrote his dissertation at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.200
Kennedy institute it was racked by multiple&nbsp;
protests the united states no longer seemed so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.560
democratic to students opposed to the vietnam&nbsp;
war but it was being invoked as a symbol even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:03.200
by those critical of American foreign policy&nbsp;
students would protest in the streets chanting usa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:09.680
ss while listening to American music and wearing&nbsp;
blue jeans when Heinz returned as a professor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.600
10 years later the fronts had hardened but so&nbsp;
had his commitment to exploring commonalities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:21.200
the maoists were arguing with the trotskyists the&nbsp;
radicals were fighting the liberals students were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:27.440
forcing professors to step over their prone bodies&nbsp;
to enter the classrooms in these days before email&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.240
members of the faculty would communicate with each&nbsp;
other by slipping notes under doors because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:39.520
couldn't stand to talk face to face in short the&nbsp;
various sides were pursuing their own white whales&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:46.000
and the ship seemed to be going down Heinz&nbsp;
did what he is so good at he built bridges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.360
indeed he helped save the Kennedy institute on&nbsp;
more than one occasion in ways that were not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:58.160
always acknowledged by the ahabs of their&nbsp;
own various crusades this bridge building&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.840
has been a distinguishing feature of Heinz's long&nbsp;
March through the institutions of higher education&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.960
he was chair of the german association&nbsp;
of American studies during the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.880
of reunification with the integration of east&nbsp;
german Americanness as the main challenge while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.080
chair of the European association of American&nbsp;
studies the challenge was integrating eastern&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:26.400
European American studies associations especially&nbsp;
those of belarus bulgaria romania and russia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:33.520
his success is evident in the vibrancy of both&nbsp;
of these institutions and his method if that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.520
the right word was grounded in the insight he had&nbsp;
had about American culture from the very beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.600
the story Heinz most often tells about American&nbsp;
studies in Europe provides an instructive contrast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:55.040
to pose collapsing house it is a story about&nbsp;
building solid structures on damaged foundations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.640
everybody has a different story&nbsp;
about America and what it represents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:05.760
nevertheless even competing stories can provide&nbsp;
a common ground this was certainly the case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.880
when former European enemies came together&nbsp;
to talk about something they had in common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:19.040
in talking about the united states they helped&nbsp;
build Europe fictions don't have to be adjudicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.280
to become institutional reality they just have&nbsp;
to be discussed this May be what heart crane was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:32.080
getting at with his bridge metaphor which Heinz&nbsp;
describes as a symbol but also as an instantiation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:39.120
as an incarnation or as he puts it in one subtitle&nbsp;
the poet's voyage in search of the incarnate world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:48.080
Heinz ii has searched for and created an&nbsp;
incarnate world his guide here is a concept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.720
of a is a concept of a democratic culture that&nbsp;
once counted as the heart of American studies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:02.320
that concept was sorely tested by the vietnam&nbsp;
war and the protest movements in the 1960s it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.520
was even more tested by the end of the cold&nbsp;
war when the state department stopped funding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:14.000
American studies abroad and scholars of American&nbsp;
studies both in the united states and in Europe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.760
began to wonder whether American studies had&nbsp;
always been an arm of American propaganda anyway&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:27.680
by the 1990s the new consensus seemed to be that&nbsp;
American culture was not democratic or pluralistic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.440
but ideological that it functioned to conceal&nbsp;
the inequalities that are still part of American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:39.360
society and still part of American foreign&nbsp;
policy these discussions have had the benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:45.200
of broadening the canon and the focus of the&nbsp;
discipline Heinz's own writing for instance on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:51.840
the harlem renaissance has profited tremendously&nbsp;
from the inclusion of previously excluded voices&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.280
nevertheless Heinz's perspective as a scholar of&nbsp;
American studies outside the continental united&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.840
states and his experience as a bridge builder has&nbsp;
taught him a lesson about institutional rebellion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.040
it is important for each generation to&nbsp;
declare its independence from its predecessors&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.880
it May be that ritual declarations of&nbsp;
independence are the most characteristic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:24.400
feature of American culture but to challenge the&nbsp;
very premise of American studies for instance an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:30.000
atonement for American exceptionalism&nbsp;
would render such protests meaningless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:37.680
even if democratic culture is a myth it is a&nbsp;
functional myth whose institutional incarnations&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:45.680
in the form of jobs journals grants and yet yes&nbsp;
institutes provide advantage for further criticism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.440
this is an argument Heinz has made in several&nbsp;
important essays on the state of the profession&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.720
his point is that American culture does&nbsp;
seem like a worthwhile object of study&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.840
whatever its role in masking America's&nbsp;
failings to live up to its own ideals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:07.840
rather than pursuing this line of argument&nbsp;
however I want to stress how congenial the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:14.320
essay is to Heinz's way of thinking the essay&nbsp;
as a form has been described as a way of saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.280
anything about everything perhaps it is&nbsp;
Heinz's background in german literature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:25.120
perhaps it is his international or his&nbsp;
institutional perspective whatever the cause he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:31.920
brings a massive range of experience and erudition&nbsp;
to bear on everything that interests him and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.920
many things interest him reading the two books of&nbsp;
essays that grateful students collected for him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.000
not all of his essays by any means but at least&nbsp;
a representative sampling I am struck I am struck&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.920
by the beauty of the prose a colleague of mine&nbsp;
once reMargreted that she loved to grade b a and m&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:56.880
a level thesis with Heinz because he always writes&nbsp;
reports that are like many essays splendid to read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:03.520
his essays also establish a line of cogent and&nbsp;
consistent arguments aGross a range of subjects&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:10.480
hines writes in that great german philological&nbsp;
tradition that finds parallels where others only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:17.360
encounter disciplinary and yes national boundaries&nbsp;
invoking for instance the french symbolist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:24.240
to make sense of emily dickinson's&nbsp;
poetics perhaps it is not too much to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:30.080
that in writing his essays Heinz has been&nbsp;
working on one great encyclopedic work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:38.080
that work is full of pieces on howls james hart&nbsp;
crane of course and william carlos williams also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:44.080
more experimental poets like creely and Susan howe&nbsp;
and frank o'hara Heinz writes about modernism and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:50.800
post-modernism he writes about pension and powers&nbsp;
the 60s and the 90s cooper in the 19th century&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:56.800
he also writes about racism and ethnicity public&nbsp;
art and the relationship between fictional and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:04.160
historical narratives he came to pound late and&nbsp;
a bit unwillingly perhaps more out of a sense of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.320
obligation to a fellow scholar than because of&nbsp;
any particular affinity to his work the result&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:16.960
an almost 1500 page bilingual edition with&nbsp;
commentary and a postscript by Heinz zIckstadtt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:23.520
is merely one of many volumes he has teamed&nbsp;
up with others to write these co-productions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:30.160
testify to the importance of dialogue in his&nbsp;
concept of democratic culture I mentioned this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.920
particular volume because I think a recent essay&nbsp;
on pound best describes the coherence between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.800
Heinz's various efforts the surface of pound's&nbsp;
poetry he says is criss-Grossed by intersecting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.640
rings as if the poet had thrown stones into&nbsp;
a body of water to make the ripple spread&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:56.880
Heinz perhaps perched atop his incarnation of&nbsp;
the brooklyn bridge has thrown many such stones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:03.840
the ripples are plain to see it is&nbsp;
important to also acknowledge their depth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:11.760
Heinz's deep argument goes back to that early&nbsp;
experience of melville who brings together so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:18.400
perspectives and sources in his own encyclopedic&nbsp;
text from melville and everything he has read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:24.480
since moby dick Heinz has learned to appreciate&nbsp;
and hear I quote from one of his essays the mixing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:31.600
of high and popular culture the d hierarchies&nbsp;
hierarchicalization of the text the text as artful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:37.840
anti-art the use of images already processed&nbsp;
through the mass media and yet repossessed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:43.680
by the first glance by the innocent eye that&nbsp;
insists on being able to see the world as if new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:53.920
these he says are all aspects of a democratic art&nbsp;
that asserts the possibility of new beginnings he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.920 --> 00:25:01.120
has also learned that quote whatever else it does&nbsp;
the novel and other forms of writing also gathers&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:08.240
and preserves evidence of a neglected cultural&nbsp;
subtext of lingering and unfulfilled desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:16.480
it is this ascetic function of literature&nbsp;
as a storehouse of unfulfilled desires&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.880
and a source of new beginnings that&nbsp;
constitutes the social importance of literature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.480
Heinz has garnered other honors including&nbsp;
from fulbright the rockefeller foundation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:36.320
the American council of learned societies the&nbsp;
canadian government and from various universities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:44.320
and American studies associations this prize i&nbsp;
think is the most fitting in his work as a writer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:52.000
a teacher a host a communicator and an&nbsp;
academic chair Heinz has built the bridges&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.840
that make communication possible&nbsp;
between the united states and Germany&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:04.560
i speak for many when I say he is my mentor my&nbsp;
role model the imagined audience of my own writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.160
and my friend thank you and&nbsp;
congratulations hindsight

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:23.280
thank you Andrew for these very personal and&nbsp;
thoughtful and touching reflections who just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:33.360
shared with us wonderful wonderful to listen&nbsp;
to and to learn even more about men's extent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:41.920
if we were here at george's house at NYU in&nbsp;
person now as you as you the people who have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.840
been here for previous sunday prize ceremonies you&nbsp;
would know that now would be the time when I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:55.760
say please join me in giving a very warm welcome&nbsp;
to Heinz ichstad whom I will now award our aid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:04.000
spotlight and Margretets on the price end of quote&nbsp;
but instead I will provide applause just by myself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.080
and instead of handing the framed price&nbsp;
certificate to lance ixtad I'm holding it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:19.280
up for him and you all to see here virtually and i&nbsp;
hope this will come aGross on the screen Sarah can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:29.280
people see that I guess great and then it will go&nbsp;
into the mail to Berlin and god knows how long it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:37.200
will take to get there um but before I go to the&nbsp;
lovely NYU mail room let's all listen to Heinz&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:46.640
igstat's acceptance reMargrets I can't wait so here&nbsp;
you go dear Heinz Ickstadt please take it away well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:56.080
thank you so much Andrew dear colleague and expert&nbsp;
in the complex matter of bicultural existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:03.200
thank you for your warm wonderful gracious&nbsp;
and much too flattering allowed archer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:11.760
my profound thanks go to Margretet Sander&nbsp;
to Juliane Camfield and New York New York&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:20.240
university's deutsches house for this year's folk&nbsp;
ma and Margret thunder prize which I accept with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:28.880
great joy but also with a sense of humility and&nbsp;
surprise for whatever I May have done to deserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:38.320
it goes way back in time I have been emeritus now&nbsp;
for 18 years after an academic career dedicated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:43.840
to the study of America and an&nbsp;
attempt to live a transatlantic life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:51.120
i accept this generous award also&nbsp;
as a representative of a generation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:57.840
a generation that grew up in post-war west&nbsp;
Germany I was nine when that war ended&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:05.120
for whom the u.s or should I say a mythical&nbsp;
America meant something very special&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:13.360
an alternative to what we had inherited from&nbsp;
our parents I remember how much I wanted to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:24.080
part of a society a country a culture a history of&nbsp;
which I could be proud and not ashamed America had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:31.520
become something of a cultural ideal during those&nbsp;
post-war years more an object of dreams and images&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:38.960
than an object of perception and knowledge to be&nbsp;
sure some argued that this idealized America was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:47.440
imposed on post-war west Germany by the us and by&nbsp;
political and economic necessities but if so this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:57.360
imposition was readily accepted by a guilty nation&nbsp;
as a golden opportunity to become democratic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:07.920
thus somehow morally more acceptable as someone&nbsp;
who grew up in the 50s and was life not only his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:15.600
academic life was shaped by the fact and even more&nbsp;
so by the fiction or even the fictions of America&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:22.320
i May be forgiven if I make use of&nbsp;
personal memories to illustrate my argument&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.400
throughout the 50s America&nbsp;
was for us something like an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:37.040
antidote to the narrowness of german post-war&nbsp;
culture with its ambivalent desire to move on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:44.000
and forget yet also to stubbornly cling to the&nbsp;
notion of a superior german cultural tradition&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:52.880
superior especially to cultureless America even&nbsp;
if that tradition was tainted by a very recent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:52.880 --> 00:31:00.480
nazi past I had an excellent teacher of the german&nbsp;
classics who had previously taught at napola&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:09.520
an elite school of the nazis and I had a very&nbsp;
exacting islam what cynical french teacher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.360
who had survived auschwitz and both of&nbsp;
these circumstances I found out only later&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:22.320
what we were thought of german history ended&nbsp;
with bismarck everything afterwards we had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:30.720
to find out ourselves and yet when I began my&nbsp;
studies in in the mid 50s I opted for german&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:38.000
literature until the conditions of gamma nistic&nbsp;
at the newly founded friar universitate Berlin&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:46.400
and the discovery that some famous&nbsp;
professors had a nazi past drove me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:52.880
to switch from germanistic to the new field&nbsp;
of American studies their seminars instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.880 --> 00:32:00.880
having 200 undergraduate level were much smaller&nbsp;
and the teaching was more open more democratic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:09.680
based on respect for what each of us had to&nbsp;
say and exercise in free intellectual exchange&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:18.080
one seminar on the work of herman melville shaped&nbsp;
my life it shaped my concept of democracy as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:26.880
a communication among equals as a mindset and&nbsp;
an everyday attitude something I could easily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:36.480
combine with my dedication to this exciting new&nbsp;
love of mine American literature my fulbright year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:44.080
in the midwest then made me realize that the us&nbsp;
was not as ideal a place as I had hoped America&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:51.600
would be I saw a lot that made me wonder the&nbsp;
facts of segregation for instance which I saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:59.200
but didn't allow to sink in on a trip to the&nbsp;
south I believe that my idea of America was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:08.240
saved by john f Kennedy I had seen his debates&nbsp;
with nixon on American tv and a few months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.800
later admired his courageous speech after the&nbsp;
disastrous invasion attempt at the bay of peace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.840
in 1963 I followed him with&nbsp;
my new jewish American wife&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:28.000
through the streets of Berlin from the&nbsp;
schonenberger art house to the freyja universitat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:33.920
his murder and the subsequent years&nbsp;
of civil rights and vietnam protests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.720
Margreted the beginning of a long process of&nbsp;
disillusion that May not be finished yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:48.880
if fritz stan has written about the five germans&nbsp;
he has known I could speak of at least four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:56.080
Americas I have taught as a mediator of American&nbsp;
literature and culture to several generations of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:03.120
german students of course some would say that it&nbsp;
never was for different Americans but always the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:09.840
same u.s of racial conflict and capitalist&nbsp;
exploitation that the only thing that had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:17.360
changed was my image of it as well as the images&nbsp;
that the changing America projected of itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:26.240
the academic field that made America its object&nbsp;
of study did not follow this process of illusion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:33.840
and decons but did not only follow this process of&nbsp;
illusion and deconstruction but was its very motor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:40.960
if as the historian alice kessler harris a&nbsp;
former president of the American association&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:48.240
once said the heart of American studies is the&nbsp;
pursuit of what constitutes democratic culture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.240
then that pursuit must be an ongoing process a&nbsp;
process pushing beyond the limits of academia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:03.600
something more than just an academic program&nbsp;
in questioning again and again dominant notions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:10.960
of what America in fact was and who belonged to&nbsp;
it this process worked as a powerful dialectic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.160
moving American studies persistently&nbsp;
away from the organic concept&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:24.400
of a unified and dominantly predominantly white&nbsp;
culture to to the pluralization of cultural worlds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:31.680
this urge to move away from any totalizing&nbsp;
perspective towards the richness of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.000
particular speed of race class or gender has&nbsp;
informed the development of American studies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.360
ever since the faith in America as a cultural&nbsp;
whole was first put into doubt then collapsed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.360
the push away from the general and&nbsp;
holistic to ever new particulars&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.560
established a new pluralism it led to the&nbsp;
discovery of a plurality of American literatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:05.760
and cultures to new texts new frames and&nbsp;
categories of analysis new border Grossings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:12.720
and concomitantly to the creation of new&nbsp;
departments of or within American studies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.880
all this has surely diversified the&nbsp;
field but also eroded its foundation

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:27.920
i have profited from these discoveries many&nbsp;
of them exciting and enriching but try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:34.720
to withstand the centrifugal pull toward&nbsp;
unlimited diversification mainly because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:39.680
as a german Americanist I have always&nbsp;
tried to look at American literature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:48.160
as an entity despite its perceived diversities&nbsp;
therefore a concept of national coherence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:53.840
still informs my approach to the study&nbsp;
of the us and its literary culture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.880
although I am aware that it must also be placed&nbsp;
into larger a transnational a cosmopolitan and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:10.560
comparative concept of frame yet I insist that&nbsp;
literature is dialogically oriented that it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:17.840
created and read not only within a particular&nbsp;
group to the exclusion of others that between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:24.960
but between groups even if they are politically&nbsp;
or socially apart or set against each other the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:30.480
idea that the reading and writing of literary&nbsp;
texts follows ethnic race or gender divisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:38.320
May respond to the ideological even the emotional&nbsp;
needs of a conflicted society or follow the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.640
dynamics of an ever greater differentiation into&nbsp;
separate academic fields or follow the dynamics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:53.600
of an ever greater differentiation into separate&nbsp;
academic uh eventually into separate departments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:02.640
yet it has held only limited appeal for me&nbsp;
since I see literature as always able even eager&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:08.560
to Gross these very lines of separation&nbsp;
by virtue of its curiosity about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:16.400
and imaginative empathy with the other a&nbsp;
curiosity that is stronger than the desire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:24.880
to belong to even to embed it in a particular&nbsp;
group that is why literature can radically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:32.880
question and overcome limited certainties even the&nbsp;
certainties and restrictions of identity politics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.040
I'm aware that this view is partly due&nbsp;
to the privilege of an outside position&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:44.240
non-American Americanists should be&nbsp;
committed to studying the united states&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.640
as something of an entity as an&nbsp;
object in front of their very eyes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.160
and I'm weary that the german association&nbsp;
of American studies whose chairman I once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:01.040
was some 30 years ago tends to forego that&nbsp;
advantage by following the American example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:08.160
too closely from our position outside we see our&nbsp;
American other differently than our colleagues&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:14.400
within the united states who are determined to&nbsp;
escape the promises as well as the rhetoric of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.800
the disciplines nationalist foundation in the&nbsp;
30s when he tried to academically establish a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:28.560
homegrown American culture against the continuing&nbsp;
continuing dominance of especially english culture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:37.120
I'm also aware that this totalizing view from&nbsp;
outside might be a generational one I remember an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:43.840
english colleague accusing the first generation&nbsp;
of European Americanists to which I belong as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:51.120
having been brainwashed by agents of American&nbsp;
cultural policy and indeed I got an idea of what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:59.360
he meant when after the opening of the Berlin&nbsp;
wall a representative of usia told me that now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:05.840
after the cold war had been won it was time&nbsp;
for American studies to ride into the sunset

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:13.280
although I found this offensive it did&nbsp;
not make me regret what I had done as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:18.800
a professor of American literature as a&nbsp;
subject although its contexts have changed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:25.280
to which I remained committed even&nbsp;
during my long years of retirement

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.920
does that imply that I am still loyal&nbsp;
to my original concept of America&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:40.800
yes and no the us surely cannot be taken as&nbsp;
mortal and ideal any longer but we can still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:48.480
learn from it positively and negatively as Susan&nbsp;
neyman has recently shown in early learning from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:55.200
the germans confronting race the memory of&nbsp;
evil there could even be a mutual learning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:02.080
process and it would indeed be foolish not to&nbsp;
look at the united states when we might benefit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:07.360
from its example does that make me&nbsp;
believe in American exceptionalism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.920
i don't think so although there are&nbsp;
many aspects of its history and culture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:19.920
that make it it's different and quite particular&nbsp;
in its contradictions self-projections and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:27.520
self-deceptions ever since the mid-19th century&nbsp;
American artists and intellectuals have seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:36.400
America's otherness vis-a-vis overbearing European&nbsp;
culture as grounded in a democratic principle that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:43.200
as herman melville once wrote to his publisher&nbsp;
every diking the declaration of independence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:49.760
does make a difference this conviction with its&nbsp;
commitment emphasis on the common and the everyday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:56.400
has been the motto of American aesthetic&nbsp;
innovation ever since it has given impulse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:02.880
to great many to great many often antagonistic&nbsp;
aesthetics from william dean howells's realism&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:10.640
to william carls williams or link's news trust&nbsp;
in the poetic resource of ordinary speech or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:17.040
deconstruction of textual hierarchy in gertrude&nbsp;
stein's poetics the linguistic democracy of each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:23.840
word having equal weight and it accounts for&nbsp;
the alignment of democracy and the arts in john&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:30.160
dewey's pragmatist aesthetics with its emphasis&nbsp;
on a continuous process of innovation and reform&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:41.760
an evolutionary drive toward what ralph waldo&nbsp;
emerson called this new yet unapproachable America&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:49.600
although the power of this aesthetic ideology&nbsp;
rooted in the democratic principle May now be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:57.280
exhausted it has worked as a creative incentive&nbsp;
far into the 20th century it has certainly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:05.440
empowered American modernism informed its&nbsp;
theories and formed its practices it makes it ver&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:11.840
its various manifestations peculiarly&nbsp;
American without making them exceptional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:21.680
in other words my faith in democracy still derives&nbsp;
from that seminar of 60 years ago more than from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:28.960
the political reality of America itself since&nbsp;
then my American wife has taught me to believe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:35.200
in the down-to-earth approach the do-it-yourself&nbsp;
tradition that have been so dominant in American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:42.480
life and surely our values worth sharing&nbsp;
if we despair of contemporary politics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:50.480
of the persistent power of the many kinds of&nbsp;
Trumpism in the us as well as in Europe we should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:56.320
also think of the counterforce of democratic&nbsp;
networking that took georgia away from Trump&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:05.360
democracy for me is thus rather a metaphor for&nbsp;
personal attitude towards others a state of mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:13.280
a way of life I associated specifically with&nbsp;
john dewey's down-to-earth utopian belief in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:20.800
creative democracy which he formulated also in&nbsp;
a period of social crisis as his credo and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:30.160
testament democracy he said is a reality only as&nbsp;
it is indeed a common place of living it is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:37.920
sole way of living which believes wholeheartedly&nbsp;
in the process of experience as end and as means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:47.280
need and desire go beyond what exists they&nbsp;
continually open the way into the unexplored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:55.200
and unattained future thank you once&nbsp;
again thank you so much friendship&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:06.800
and quits out sound thanks for joining in the&nbsp;
chorus here uh Andrew and marty thank you for your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:13.360
powerful and insightful speech that transported&nbsp;
me back to the john f Kennedy institute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:25.840
in the uh late 80s or early 90s or 1928 whenever&nbsp;
it was uh reminded me of how why i've always been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:34.320
so inspired by you and how you've put me&nbsp;
on a path that has led to this rule so um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:42.160
thank you thank you again Juliane it's been such&nbsp;
a pleasure to be able to give you this award and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:51.920
uh madrid and I are so you accepted it and I want&nbsp;
to thank you all Andrew marty Sarah Margret jones&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:58.240
Susanna it takes a village to put together these&nbsp;
things and this was so meaningful I hope not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:06.000
for me but for everyone else so thank you friends&nbsp;
extra for all you've done as a bridge builder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:15.920
that is a wonderful description uh in midler&nbsp;
from midler between cultures and worlds and times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.520
and look forward to to you know for this&nbsp;
dialogue to be continued by by your many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:31.760
students and people you have inspired on both&nbsp;
sides of the atlantic and probably also elsewhere&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:39.360
to make it into a bigger picture um it's always&nbsp;
strange to end things so abruptly because usually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:45.280
we would have a reception and then we would take&nbsp;
out the guests for dinner so it's sad but we can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:51.520
do that but we will be back in person at some&nbsp;
point and we will be taking out our distinguished&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:58.240
speakers for dinners and luncheons again to&nbsp;
exchange views in a more informal setting in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:05.280
the meantime let me just mention that our annual&nbsp;
festival neue literature is starting on thursday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:14.080
uh the topic will be turn and face the strange&nbsp;
which seems timely every day these days so if&nbsp;&nbsp;

york based german photographer named stefan falca&nbsp;&nbsp;

documented what was happening and very changed new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:54.320
york we are showing these right now and hopefully&nbsp;
